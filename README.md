Pythagorean Expectation Metric in Sports
This project explores the Pythagorean Expectation metric in three different sports: Baseball, Cricket, and Football (Soccer). By calculating the Pythagorean Expectation for teams in these sports, we can identify overachievers and underachievers based on their actual performance compared to their expected performance. This README provides an overview of the methodology and findings for each sport.

# Introduction

The Pythagorean Expectation is a formula that estimates the expected winning percentage of a team based on the number of points (or goals/runs) they score and concede. This project applies this metric to three different sports to analyze team performances in a recent season.

# Pythagorean Expectation Formulae

Baseball (NBA)
For baseball, we use the NBA (National Baseball Association) data. The formula is:

Pythagorean Expectation = (Points Scored squared) / (Points Scored squared + Points Conceded squared)

For football (soccer), we use data from the English Premier League (EPL). The formula is:

Pythagorean Expectation = (Total Goals Scored squared) / (Total Goals Scored squared + Total Goals Conceded squared)

For cricket, we analyze data from the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2023 season. The formula is similar:

Pythagorean Expectation = (Total Runs Scored squared) / (Total Runs Scored squared + Total Runs Conceded squared)


# Methodology

Data Collection: Gather data on points/goals/runs scored and conceded by teams in the NBA, EPL, and IPL 2023 season.

Calculation: Compute the Pythagorean Expectation for each team using the respective formula.

Comparison: Compare the expected winning percentage to the actual winning percentage.

Classification: Identify teams as overachievers if their actual winning percentage is greater than their Pythagorean Expectation, and underachievers if it is less.
